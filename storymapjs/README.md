# [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com)

## Intro

StoryMapJS should only be used when the reader needs to be lead along a route. The [Country Drive](http://pages.registerguard.com/roadside-bounty/) is a good example because it's showing readers a possible route.

Please don't use it to show the location of different things just to show the location. Use a standard map in that case.

## How to create from scratch

1. Go to [storymap.knightlab.com](http://storymap.knightlab.com) and click `Make a storymap now`.
1. Log in using the rgnews.registerguard@gmail.com credentials. (This can be finicky, just wait it out. If nothing happens in a minute or two, try refreshing. I've had to wait it out for a few minutes on the most recent login.)
1. Select new storymap (or click the one you want to edit).
1. Along the left side there is a vertical strip where each one of your slides will go. This whole process can be thought of as a slideshow, each slide just has a specific location associated with it.
1. The top slide is your home slide and it will display all of the point you add. Add a headline, description and image as needed.
1. Add a new slide and enter a location into the `Search` bar. This will set your point for this slide. To update the location, simply do another search. Add a headline, description and image as needed.
1. Add as many slides as you want, make sure to `Save` as you go.
1. Preview your work at any time by clicking on the `Preview` tab. (This can be finicky, especially with the home screen.)
1. `Publish Changes` when you're all done. Click `Share` and copy the embed code.
1. Paste that into WebHTML for it at the top, WebEmbed for it to go at the bottom of the story.
